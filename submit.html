  <p><b><mark>Call for Papers</mark></b>
    We are sourcing short, four-page papers focusing on discrete abstractions such as objects, concepts, and events and the causal structure that relates them. Specific topics of interest include:
    <ul>
      <li>Benchmarks that quantitatively highlight the benefits of abstract representations</li>
      <li>Methods that extract/reason/ or discover abstract entities</li>
      <li>Integrating ideas from the causality literature into neural network architectures</li>
      <li>Integrating tools from deep learning into more traditional causal discovery approaches, which may result in lacks of recovery guarantees</li>
      <li>Inference of relations between observed or unobserved variables</li>
      <li>Self-supervised learning of structured representations</li>
      <li>Reasoning tasks, interventional and counterfactual questions</li>
      <li>Theoretical understanding on the challenges of learning abstractions and invariances from data</li>
      <li>Applications (e.g. in computer vision, audio processing, robotics)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><b> Submission Policy: </b></p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>We encourage 4 page submissions but are enforcing a hard maximum of 5, plus any number of pages for references and supplementary material. We ask authors to use the supplementary material only for minor details that do not fit in the main paper. We reserve the right to desk reject papers that strongly violate this format (e.g. more than 5 pages main content before references)</li>
    <li>Submissions should be fully anonymized for double-blind review.</li>
    <li>Papers should use <a href="todo">this style file</a>.</li>
    <li>Dual submission policy: submissions cannot have appeared at previous conferences or at ICLR 2022.</li>
    <li>Accepted submissions will appear on the workshop website (non-archival).</li>
  </ul>
